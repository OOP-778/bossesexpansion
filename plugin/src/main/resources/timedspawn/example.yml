# How often should it execute this timed spawn?
# This is optional value
# You can use days(1), weeks(1,2,3,4), months(1,2,3,4)
# Examples:
# days(2) ~ will run every 2 days
# weeks(2, 1) ~ will run every 2 weeks at the first day of the week
# months(2, 3, 1) ~ will run every 2 months third week first day
every: "days(1)"

# Time zone
# You can define any timezone
# Or you can remove this value
# And System timezone will be used
timezone: "UTC+3"

# Time that it will run at if the `every`
# Is not defined, it will then act as how often it will run
# If 'every' is defined, it will run at that specific time
# The time is offset starting from 00:00 so 2pm would be 14h
time: "14h"

# Spawn points
points:
  # There's one type: worldguard
  type: worldguard

  # Value of the defined type
  value: "warzone"

# Which bosses will it spawn?
# You can also use boss(name, amount) to automatically find bosses
bosses:
  - "boss[skeletalKing, rand(2, 6)]"

# Should all bosses be grouped into one?
# Which would end up into single actions executed
# Also the actions will execute if grouping is enabled only
# When all of the spawned bosses are dead
grouping:
  enabled: false

  # Name of the boss that will be the main boss
  # That actions will run on & rewards
  # If there's multiple of the same type, it will
  # Then use the first one as the lead
  lead: "skeletalKing"
